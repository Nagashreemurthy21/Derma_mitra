### Intelligent Early Skin Risk Awareness & Referral Platform

---

## Vision
To ensure that minor skin problems never become major health crises by enabling early recognition, informed action, and timely care for underserved communities.

---

## The Problem
In many rural and low-resource regions, skin infections are often ignored because of:
- Limited access to dermatologists  
- Travel and treatment costs  
- Low awareness of severity  
- Delay in seeking medical help  

What begins as a small rash can evolve into a serious or life-threatening condition.

---

## Our Solution
DermaMitra is an AI-assisted awareness and triage system.

Users can:
- Upload or capture an image of the affected skin area  
- Describe symptoms via text or voice  
- Receive risk-based insights  
- Understand seriousness through a simple color indicator  
- Follow safe early-care guidance  
- Know when and where to seek professional help  

⚠️ The platform supports decision-making and does **not** replace doctors.
