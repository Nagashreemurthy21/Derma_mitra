## Executive Summary

DermaMitra is a responsible AI-powered decision-support platform designed to bridge the critical gap in dermatological healthcare access for rural and low-resource communities. The system empowers community health workers (CHWs) and individuals to identify potential skin health risks early, understand severity levels, and make informed decisions about seeking appropriate medical care.

**Critical Positioning:** DermaMitra is explicitly designed as a clinical decision-support tool, not a diagnostic system. It augments—never replaces—professional medical judgment and serves as a triage and awareness mechanism to improve healthcare access equity.

### 1.1 Vision Statement

To democratize access to early skin health awareness in underserved communities worldwide, reducing preventable complications through responsible AI-assisted risk stratification and timely medical referrals.

### 1.2 Mission Statement

DermaMitra's mission is to:
- Provide accessible, culturally-sensitive skin health risk awareness tools for populations with limited healthcare infrastructure
- Empower community health workers with AI-assisted decision support that respects their expertise and local knowledge

- Build trust through transparent, ethical AI practices that prioritize patient safety and data privacy
- Create measurable improvements in health-seeking behavior and clinical outcomes in target communities

### 1.3 Core Principles

1. **Safety First:** Conservative risk stratification that errs on the side of medical referral
2. **Human-Centered:** Technology serves healthcare workers and patients, not the reverse
3. **Transparency:** Clear communication about system capabilities and limitations
4. **Equity:** Designed for low-literacy, low-connectivity, and resource-constrained environments
5. **Accountability:** Traceable decision pathways and continuous monitoring for bias and errors
