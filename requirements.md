# Requirements Document

## Project Title
DermaMitra – Intelligent Early Skin Risk Awareness & Referral Platform

---

## 1. Product Vision
To democratize dermatology awareness by enabling every individual, regardless of geography or income, to recognize skin risk early and seek timely, appropriate care.

---

## 2. Background & Motivation
Across rural and resource-constrained regions, treatable skin conditions frequently escalate due to delayed recognition and limited access to specialists. Lack of early triage results in preventable suffering, financial burden, and overcrowded tertiary hospitals.

A scalable, AI-assisted awareness layer can significantly shift healthcare from reactive treatment to proactive prevention.

---

## 3. Mission Statement
Empower communities with actionable, understandable, and trustworthy skin health guidance within minutes.

---

## 4. Problem Definition
Users face:
- Limited dermatology access
- Long travel distances
- Cost barriers
- Underestimation of symptoms
- Absence of triage support

There is a need for a first-line digital guide that helps users decide **what to do next**.

---

## 5. Solution Overview
DermaMitra provides AI-assisted risk stratification by analyzing images and symptom descriptions and translating them into:

- understandable risk levels
- practical early-care steps
- time-sensitive referral advice

The system is a **decision-support tool**, not a diagnostic authority.

- Community health workers
- Rural clinics
- NGOs
- Public health planners
- Telemedicine providers

---
